| Filter Screen           | This screen is separated from the main screen (list screen) because the filter screen has a broad task and in the future it can have a lot of logic | ![import icon](./image/Image11.png) |
| Add Data Scre           | The `add data screen` is separated because it has different tasks from other screens and in the future it will have many types of input such as autocomplate, radio button or checkbox | ![import icon](./image/Image13.png) |
| Edit Data Screen        | on this screen it has the same appearance as `add data screen` but this screen is UI separated from other screens because it has a different task but this screen uses the same code as adding a data screen | ![import icon](./image/Image14.png) |
